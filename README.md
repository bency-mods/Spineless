Get started with Spineless:

Using shears or any kind of axe, right click a cactus.
It will be stripped of its spines, and drop a few in the process (0-6)

On destroying a stripped cactus, it will drop raw cactus flesh. This can be cooked, to become cooked cactus flesh. It doesn't look that appetising, but restores ample hunger and saturation!

The spines of a cactus can also be used as a source of fuel- though not a great one. Just useful if you're in a pinch.
Same with cooked cactus- it doesn't cook super fast, to balance it out a little!
